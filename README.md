# Book-Recommendation-Model-using-Collaborative-Filtering

With an increasing amount of information on the internet and a considerable increase in the number of users, it is essential for companies to search, map, and offer relevant information based on the preferences of users. An important functional means of providing personalized service to users is __Recommendation System__. This system uses Machine Learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to suggest items, content, or services that should be of interest to customers based on their past choices or by analysing the preferences of similar users. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc. use recommender systems to help their users to identify the correct product or content for them.

The project aims to create a __Book recommendation system__ that best predicts user interests and recommend the suitable/appropriate books to them, using various approaches.

# Steps Performed
1) __Data Preprocessing__ : Checked for outliers, incorrect values, missing values, duplicate, performed data type correction and string formatting.
2) __Merging of datasets__ : In this project, recommender systems were built utilizing only explicit ratings. So finally,a new dataframe by merging the books dataset ,explicit ratings dataset and users dataset is prepared.
3) __Exploratory Data Analysis__ : Performed Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis with various graphs and plots to better understand the distribution of features and their relationships.
4) __Model Building__: Implementation of various Recommender System approaches like User Based Collaborative Filtering and Item based Collaborative Filtering.
      
# Tools and Technologies used
1) __Language__ : Python
2) __IDE__ : Jupyter Notebook
3) __Pandas__ : For loading the dataset and performing data wrangling
4) __Matplotlib__: For data visualization.
5) __Seaborn__: For data visualization.
5) __NumPy__: For some math operations in predictions.
6) __Sklearn__: For the purpose of analysis,prediction and evaluation

# Conclusion

Finally, the model is able to recommend books by giving either a user as an input or a book title
